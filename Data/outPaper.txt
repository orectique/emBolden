WE addREss thEsE IDENTIFICATION CHALLENGES By CoNdUCtiNG a RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL

(RCT) With a FoR-PRoﬁt BANK iN CoLomBia WhERE WE WERE aBLE to ChaNGE thE CREDIT EVAL-

UatioN PRoCEss oF thE BANK. WE ALSO WERE aBLE to OBTAIN DIRECT MEASURES oF thE iNPUts to

atE thE EFFECT oF CREDIT SCORING CETERIS PARIBUS, HOLDING CONSTANT aLL othER dEtERmiNaNts oF

LENDING OUTCOMES. WE ALSO DESIGN a NOVEL TREATMENT ARM that ALLOWS US to mEasURE thE

WhiCh WE EXPLaiN iN moRE dEtaiL BELOW, mEasUREs hoW COMMITTEE BEHAVIOR CHANGES WhEN

WE CoNdUCt thE REsEaRCh With a FoR-PRoﬁt BANK iN CoLomBia sPECiaLizEd iN LOANs to

SMALL ENTERPRISES. SiNCE most oF thE PROSPECTIVE BORROWERS do Not haVE aUDItEd ﬁNaNCiaL

statEmENts, thE BANK’s SCREENING PROCESS BEGINS WhEN LOAN OFFICERS COLLECT BORROWER INFOR-

MATION iN thE ﬁELd (E.G., mEasUREs oF saLEs, COSTS, DEMAND VoLatiLity). This IMPLiEs that

most oF thE iNFoRMATION is oNLy VERiﬁaBLE By thE LOAN OFFICER Who COLLECTS it. ThE iNFoRma-

tioN is thEN EVaLUatEd By a CREDIt COMMITtEE that iNCLUdEs thE LOAN OFFICER Who COLLECTS thE

iNFoRMATION aNd thE LOCAL BRANCH MANAGER. WhEN COMMITTEES CANNOT REACH a DECISION,

thEy CaN TAKE ACTIONS that CREATE SUBSTANTIAL TRANSACTION COSTS FoR thE BANK: thEy EithER

REFER thE APPLiCatioN to thE REGIONAL MANAGER Who WiLL thEN MAKE thE CREDIT DECISION, oR

sEND thE oﬃCER to COLLECT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION aNd MAKE thE DECISION iN a SECOND ROUND

oF EVALUATION. SiNCE COMMITtEE COMPENSATION dEPENDs oNLy oN thE SIZE aNd PERFoRmaNCE

oF thE LOAN PORTFOLIO, Both ACTIONS REPREsENt a POTENTIAL soURCE oF AGENCY CONFLICTS: COM-

MITTEE MEMBERS MAY FREE-RidE oN REGIONAL MANAGERs By REFERRiNG too MANY APPLICATIONS oR

ENGaGE iN maNy RoUNds oF WASTEFUL INFORMATION COLLECTION to BUiLd a REPUtatioN oF BEiNG

DILLiGENt.

ThE BANK DEVELOPED a CREDIT SCORING MODEL With thE oBJECtiVE oF REdUCiNG thE iNFoR-

MATION PROCESSING aNd MONITORING COSTS RESULTING FRom thE EVALUATION oF APPLiCatioNs.5

To TEST thE IMPaCt oF thE SCORING MODEL, WE dEsiGN thE tRiaL With a CONTROL GROUP aNd

TWO TREATMENTS. IN thE CoNtRoL, GRoUP thE COMMITTEES MAKE DECISIONS USING thE dEtaiLEd

iNFoRMATION COLLECTED By thE LOAN OFFICER BUt WithoUt oBsERViNG thE APPLiCaNt’s sCoRE. FoR

thE BANK, this is thE USUAL SCREENING PROCESS.

IN thE ﬁRst tREatmENt (T 1), WE PRoVidE

thE APPLiCaNt’s sCoRE to thE CREDIt COMMITtEE as it EVaLUatEs thE APPLiCatioN. WE USE this

tREatmENt to EVaLUatE thE oVERaLL EFFECT oF sCoREs oN COMMITtEE OUTPUT, thRoUGh iNFoRma-

tioN as WELL as INCENTIVES. IN thE SECOND TREATMENT GROUP (T 2), WE aIM to sEPaRatE thE

iNFoRMATION EFFECT oF thE sCoRE, FRom its EFFECT thRoUGh INCENTIVES. FoR that PURPosE, WE

ASK thE COMMITtEE to MAKE aN EVALUATION oF thE APPLiCatioN BEFoRE oBsERViNG thE VaLUE oF

thE sCoRE (iNtERIM DECISION), BUt KNoWiNG that thE SCORE WOULD BE OBSERVABLE IMMEDIATELY

aFtER thE iNtERIM DECISION has BEEN MADE. ALthoUGh COMMITtEEs CoULd REVisE thE iNtERIM

DECISION aFtER SEEiNG thE sCoRE to MAKE a FINAL DECISION, WE FIND that COMMITtEEs aLmost

NEVER do so. ComPaRiNG thE iNtERIM DECISION iN T 2 aNd thE CONTROL GROUP ALLOWS US to

EVALUATE WHETHER SCORES AFFECT thE COMMITtEE mEmBERs’ INCENTIVES, EVEN WhEN thERE is No

ChaNGE iN thE iNFoRMATION thEy PossEs.

IN a FoUR-MONTH PILOT INCLUDING EIGHT URBAN BRANCHES, WE RoLLEd oUt thE SCORING MODEL

aNd RANDOMLY ASSIGNED LOAN APPLICATIONS WITHIN a COMMITtEE to ONE oF thE thREE tREatmENt

5This MODEL Was DEVELOPED INDEPENDENTLY FRom thE PREsENt REsEaRCh By a ﬁNaNCiaL sERViCE CoNsULtiNG

aRms. RaNdomiziNG WithiN COMMITtEEs, aFtER thE BoRRoWER’s iNFoRMATION is COLLECTED, as-

sUREs that thE tREatmENt is Not CoRRELatEd With thE INFORMATION CONTENT oF thE APPLiCatioNs

(E.G., iF LOAN OFFICERS KNEW WhiCh TREATMENT ARM aN APPLiCatioN Was ASSIGNED to BEFoRE-

HAND, thEy COULD ADJUST thEiR INFORMATION COLLECTION EFFORT DEPENDING oN thE tREatmENt

aRm). This DESIGN COMES at thE POTENTIAL COST oF SPILLOVER EFFECTS, iF CREDIT COMMITTEES LEARN

oVER TIME to iNFER thE SCORE EVEN iN APPLiCatioNs that do Not iNCLUdE it. This COULD LEAD

to aN ATTENUATION BIAS oVER TIME. FoR this REasoN, WE EXPLoit thE tIMiNG oF thE PILOT aNd

COMPLEmENt thE EXPERIMENTaL REsULts With DIﬀERENCE-iN-DIFFERENCES ESTIMATES that COMPaRE

OUTCOMES iN thE EIGHT PILOT BRANCHES With MATCHED CONTROL BRANCHES. ThE idENtiﬁCatioN

aNd Not thE BANK, SELECTED thE tIMiNG aNd thE idENtity oF thE PILOT BRANCHEs.

ThE MAIN FINDINGS CaN BE sUmmaRizEd as FoLLOWs. FiRst, thE aVaiLaBiLity oF a CREDIT SCORE

has a POSITIVE EFFECT oN COMMITtEE EﬀoRt (TIME SPENT PER APPLICATION) aNd OUTPUT (FRaC-

tioN oF APPLiCatioNs WhERE thE COMMITtEE REaChEs a DECISION). ThE iNCREasE iN EﬀoRt aNd

OUTPUT is CoNCENtRatEd iN maRGiNaL—DIﬃCULt to EVaLUatE—APPLiCatioNs (E.G., APPLiCatioNs

FoR LARGER AMOUNTS). ThE OUTPUT GAIN is ECONOMICALLY LARGE: thE FRACTION oF NON-DECISIONS

dRoPs By moRE thaN 40% WhEN COMMITtEEs oBsERVE a sCoRE. WE ALSO FIND EVIDENCE SUGGES-

tiVE oF LEARNING SPILLOVERS —COMMITtEE OUTPUT ALSO INCREASEs iN CONTROL APPLICATIONS By thE

FoURth MONTH oF thE tRiaL— WhiCh IMPLiEs that thE ESTIMATES REPRESENT a LOWER BOUND oN

MITtEE EﬀoRt aRE COMPLEmENtaRy iNPUts iN thE EVALUATION oF MARGINAL APPLICATIONS, aNd

that sCoREs aNd WORKER EFFORT SUBSTITUTE FoR othER EXPENsiVE iNPUts iN LOAN PRODUCTION,

ThE SECOND SET oF FINDiNGs is oBtaiNEd FRom thE aNaLysis oF tREatmENt T 2.

INDUCEs COMMITtEEs to PRodUCE moRE OUTPUT, hoLDING thEiR INFORMATION SET CONSTANT. Most

BEhaVioR iN oUR SETtiNG is By IMPRoViNG its mEmBERs’ IMPLiCit INCENTIVES to WoRK.

FiNaLLy, WE COMPaRE PILOT aNd CONTROL BRANCHES to EVaLUatE thE EFFECT oN BoRRoWER

BORROWERS ALONG OBSERVABLE (AVERAGE CREDIT SCORE, REQUESTED LOAN AMOUNT) oR UNoBsERVaBLE

ThE LOAN SCREENING PROCESS has THREE UNIQUE FEATURES. FiRst, iN thE aBsENCE oF aUDItEd

A CoNsEqUENCE oF PREsCREENiNG aNd EX ANTE RISK ADJUSTMENTS iN REQUESTED LOAN AMOUNTS is

ThE APPLICATION FILE is REViEWEd By a CREDIT COMMITTEE COMPOSED oF thE LOAN OFFICER

Who COLLECTS thE iNFoRMATION, thE BRANCH MANAGER (thE LOAN OFFICER’s IMmEDIatE sUPERioR),

12ALL thE INFORMATION REGARDING POTENTIAL APPLICANTS that do Not REaCh thE COMMITTEE REVIEW STAGE is

aNd ONE oR TWO ADDITIONAL CREDIT SPECIALISTS. ThE COMMITtEE’s MAIN TASK is to REaCh a

DECISION oN aN APPLiCatioN (ACCEPT thE APPLiCatioN aNd SET thE tERms, oR REJECt it). ThE

COMMITTEE MAY MAKE MODIFICATIONS to thE AMOUNT aNd matURity oF thE REQUESTED LOAN to

IMPRoVE its EXPECtEd PRoﬁtaBiLity. FoR EXamPLE, thE COMMITTEE MAY oNLy APPRoVE $US500

oF a $US1,000 REQUESTED AMOUNT iF thE BoRRoWER is dEEmEd to BE too UNLiKELy to REPay

thE LattER AMOUNT. ALtERNatiVELy, thE COMMITTEE MAY APPROVE aN AMOUNT LaRGER thaN

aRE moRE sKiLLEd aNd EXPERiENCEd thaN COMMITtEE mEmBERs aNd aRE EXPECtEd to BE moRE

LiKELy to REaCh thE CoRRECt DECISION oN DIFFICULT APPLICATIONS. ThE SECOND OPTION is to

sEND thE oﬃCER to COLLECT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION aBoUt thE BoRRoWER. IN this CasE, thE

COMMITTEE MUST REVIEW thE APPLiCatioN aGaiN aFtER thE iNFoRMATION is COLLECTED aNd REaCh

a DECISION (oR sEND thE APPLiCatioN to thE REGIONAL MANAGER).

BaNCaMia maNaGERs EXPREssEd dURiNG iNFoRmaL iNtERViEWs that REFERRaLs aNd adDItioNaL

ThE BASE FIXED WAGE oF a REGIONAL MANAGER is FoUR to EIGHT TIMES that oF a LOAN OFFICER,

WhiCh GiVEs a LOWER BOUND oN thE iNCREmENtaL COST oF a REFERRaL to UPPER maNaGEmENt.

13LoaNs aBoVE 8 MILLION PESOS GO DIRECTLY to thE REGIONAL MANAGER FoR APPRoVaL. RaNdomizatioN iNsUREs
that this mEChaNiCaL RELatioNshiP BEtWEEN LOAN SIZE aNd APPRoVaL LEVEL is oRthoGoNaL to thE sCoREs. ALso,
adDING thE APPLICATION AMOUNT as a CoNtRoL doEs Not ChaNGE thE ESTIMATED EFFECT oF sCoREs.

11

FURthER, SINCE thE REGIONAL MANAGER MUST EVALUATE thE APPLICATION WITHOUT thE oﬃCER that

COLLECTED thE iNFoRMATION PREsENt, shE MUST INCUR ADDITIONAL COMMUNICATION COSTS to aCCEss

aNy iNFoRMATION Not REﬂECtEd iN thE APPLiCatioN. REFERRaLs IMPLy adDItioNaL dELay COSTS.

This is iN PaRt DUE to thE LARGE VOLUME oF REFERREd APPLiCatioNs aNd thE TIME CONSTRAINTS

oF REGIONAL MANAGERs Who sUPERVisE BEtWEEN 15 aNd 80 OFFICES.

2.2 CREDIt SCoREs

IN 2010, BaNCaMia CoNtRaCtEd With aN EXTERNAL CONSULTING FIRM thE dEVELoPmENt oF a

CREDIT RISK MODEL that USEs thE HISTORICAL INFORMATION iN thE CREDIT APPLICATIONS to PREDICt

thE REPAYMENT PERFORMANCE oF PROSPECTIVE BORROWERS. ThE SCORING MODEL USES Both qUaN-

titatiVE (GENDER, aGE, LoCatioN, NUmBER oF yEaRs iN BUSiNEss, FREqUENCy oF LATE PAYMENTS iN

DIVERsity oF iNCOME) iNFoRMATION iN thE APPLiCatioNs. ThE RISK MODEL WOULD BE USEd to

PRodUCE a CREDIT RISK SCORE to BE iNCLUdEd iN thE APPLICATION FILE. MaNaGEmENt’s statEd

oBJECtiVE is to “IMPRoVE idENtiﬁCatioN oF thE BEst aNd WoRst CLiENts, dECENtRaLizE thE LOAN

APPRoVaL PRoCEss, aNd REdUCE thE LABOR COSTS INVOLVED iN LOAN APPLICATION EVALUATION.”16 It

mEaNt to PRoVidE INCENTIVES to ISSUE SMALL LOANS to thE RISKiEst BoRRoWERs—COMPENSATION BASED soLELy oN
thE doLLaR VoLUmE oF LENDING WOULD DISCOURAGE OFFICERS FRom MAKING SMALL LOANS.

15ThERE aRE TWO POTENTIAL REASONS FoR COMPENsatiNG COMMITtEEs FoR LOANS ISSUED. FiRst, PAY BASED oN
DECISIONS MADE PENALIZES COMMITTEES FoR REFERRaLs, WhiCh MAY LEAD to too MANY BAD DECISIONS at thE
COMMITtEE LEVEL. SECoNd, PAY BASED oN DECISIONS MADE WOULD ELIMINATE thE oﬃCER’s INCENTIVES to moNitoR
thE BoRRoWER aFtER thE LOAN has BEEN ISSUED.
16SoURCE: iNtERViEWs With maNaGEmENt.

12

is IMPoRtaNt to NotE that thE CREDIT SCORE RELIES ENTIRELY oN iNFoRMATION that LOAN OFFICERS

WOULD ALSO haVE had aNyWAY, SINCE thE SCORE RELIES oN thE iNFoRMATION COLLECTED By LOAN

oﬃCERs.

ThE sCoRE is a PRoXy FoR thE EXPECTED DEFAULT PROBABILITY oF thE LOAN. FiGURE 1, PaNEL

(a), PLOTS thE oUt-oF-samPLE RELatioNshiP BEtWEEN thE DEFAULT PRoBaBiLity aNd sCoRE iN thE

PoPULatioN oF LOANS ISSUED dURiNG OCtoBER 2010 (thE SCORING MODEL is CaLiBRatEd USING

PaymENts aRE moRE thaN 30 DAYS OVERDUE at siX oR TWELVE MONTHS aFtER thE LOAN is ISSUED.

ThERE is a STRONG POSITIVE ASSOCIATION BEtWEEN CREDIT SCOREs aNd DEFAULT PROBABILITIES. ThE

TIGHT STANDARD ERROR BAND IMPLIES that sCoREs haVE a Good oUt-oF-SAMPLE PREDICTIVE POWER

FoR FUtURE DEFAULT, aNd that thE DATA iN thE APPLiCatioN is iNFoRmatiVE aBoUt BoRRoWERs’

REPaymENt PRosPECts.

ThERE is a NEGatiVE RELatioNshiP BEtWEEN REQUESTED LOAN AMOUNTS aNd DEFAULT PRoBa-

BiLity iN thE LOAN POPULATION (FiGURE 1, PaNEL (B)). This RELatioNshiP is CoNsistENt With

LOAN OFFICERS SCREENING LARGE APPLICATIONS By RISKy BoRRoWERs, oR RECOMMENDING RISKY BOR-

RoWERs to REQUEST SMALLER LOAN AMOUNTS. This RELatioNshiP sUGGEsts that LOAN OFFICERS FORM

aN EstIMatE oF thE BoRRoWER’s DEFAULT PRoBaBiLity BEFoRE BRiNGiNG thE APPLiCatioN to thE

COMMITtEE.

3 REsEaRCh DEsiGN aNd DEsCRiPtiVE StatistiCs

WE dEsiGN a RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) With TWO GOALS. ThE ﬁRst is to mEasURE

thE CAUSAL EFFECT oF sCoREs oN COMMITtEE EﬀoRt aNd OUTPUT, as WELL as OVERALL LOAN OUTPUT

aNd PERFoRmaNCE. ThE SECOND GOAL is to dECOMPosE thE CAUSAL EFFECT oF sCoREs iNto TWO

BRoad mEChaNisms: thE PRoVisioN oF iNFoRMATION aNd, HOLDING INFORMATION CONSTANT, thE

PRoVisioN oF INCENTIVES.

IN thE PURE INFORMATION PROVISION MECHANISM, sCoREs PRoVidE a siGNaL oF BoRRoWER

BASED SCORE MAY PROVIDE a moRE PRECisE siGNaL oF thE CREDITWORthiNEss oF thE BoRRoWER

thaN thE COMMITtEE CaN GATHER BASED oN thEiR oWN ASSESSMENT. ALtERNatiVELy, thE sCoRE

MAY PRoVidE thE samE iNFoRMATION that thE COMMITtEE CaN GathER FRom thE APPLiCatioN,

BUt at a LOWER COST. ALso, thE SCORE MAY REDUCE thE COST oF COMmUNiCatiNG thE iNFoRMATION

COLLECTED By thE LOAN OFFICER to thE othER COMMITtEE mEmBERs By PRoViDING a sIMPLE to

INTERPRET SUMMARY STATISTIC.

ThE SCORE MAY ALSO AFFECT thE COMMITTEE MEMBERS INCENTIVES to DIVULGE aNd USE thE

iNFoRMATION thEy aLREady PossEss By PRoViDING a PUBLICLY OBSERVABLE aNd VERiﬁaBLE mEasURE

oF thE CREDITWORthiNEss oF thE BoRRoWER. FoR EXamPLE, SCORES MAY DETER thE COMMITtEE

FRom oVERstatiNG thE CREDITWORthiNEss oF FamiLy, FRiENDs, oR aCqUaiNtaNCEs oF its mEmBERs.

A SCORE MAY ALSO EMBOLDEN thE COMMITtEE to MAKE DECISIONS iN MARGINAL CASES BECaUSE

its mEmBERs CaN USE thE sCoRE to JUSTIFY thE DECISION iF thE LOAN DEFAULTS EX POST. ON thE

othER HAND, PRECisELy BECaUSE thE SCORE MAY JUSTIFY DECISIONS EX POST, it MAY DIsCoURaGE

COMMITtEE mEmBERs FRom USING VALUABLE PRIVATE INFORMATION iN thE dELiBERatioN (CatERiNG

EFFECT at aLL, BUt iF thERE is, thE DIRECtioN oF thE EFFECT is amBiGUoUS.

ThE FUNdamENtaL FEatURE oF thE INCENTIVE MECHANISM is that it AFFECTS OUTCOMES HOLDING

thE INFORMATION SET oF thE COMMITtEE CoNstaNt. ThUS, to isoLatE thE INCENTIVE EFFECT, WE

dEsiGN a tREatmENt that ALLOWS US to mEasURE hoW thE COMMITtEE’s ACTIONS CHANGE WhEN

3.1 PiLot DEsiGN

WE RaNdomizE iN REAL TIME at thE APPLICATION LEVEL to GUaRaNtEE that tREatmENt is

oRthoGoNaL to APPLICANT CHARACTERISTICS aNd thE INFORMATION GATHERING EFFORT By thE LOAN

ThUS, oUR ESTIMATES CaN BE iNtERPREtEd as LOWER BOUNDS oN thE tREatmENt EFFECT oF sCoREs.

IN thE CONTROL GROUP, thE COMMITtEE EVaLUatEs thE APPLICATION WITHOUT OBSERVING thE

sCoRE. IN thE FIRST TREATMENT GROUP (T 1), thE COMMITtEE RECEiVEs thE sCoRE BEFoRE EVALUATING

thE APPLiCatioN. This FIRST TREATMENT ALLOWS US to mEasURE thE oVERaLL EFFECT oF sCoREs

oN COMMITtEE EﬀoRt, OUTPUT, aNd PRodUCtiVity.

IN thE SECOND TREATMENT GROUP (T 2),

thE COMMITtEE MAKES aN iNtERIM, NON-BiNDING, DECISION BEFoRE RECEiViNG thE sCoRE. ThE

COMMITtEE MAKES thE INTERIM DECISION KNOWING that thE sCoRE WiLL BECOME AVAILABLE to thE

ThE MAIN ADVANTAGE oF thE dEsiGN oF T 2 is that it ALLOWS MEASURING thE INCENTIVE EFFECT

To EVaLUatE this, WE ChaRaCtERizE thE EFFECT oF sCoREs oN thE DIstRiBUtioN oF DECISION

IN CONTROL GROUP APPLICATIONS, thE PRoBaBiLity oF maKiNG a DECISION DECLINES (PaNEL (a))

BEtWEEN iNtERIM aNd FINAL ACTION OCCURS DUE to aN iNCREasE iN NUmBER oF DECISIONS MADE

iNsiGNiﬁCaNt FoR Both INTERIM DECISIONS aNd FINAL ONES.

ThE MAIN CONCLUSION FRom this SET oF REsULts is that thE BULK oF thE EFFECT oF sCoREs

oN COMMITTEE OUTPUT OCCURS EVEN WhiLE hoLDING COMMITtEEs’ INFORMATION SET CONSTANT.

This is CoNsistENt With aN INCENTIVE EFFECT oF sCoREs oN OUTPUT: SCORES INDUCE COMMITTEES

to MAKE moRE DECISIONS. HoWEVER, RECaLL FRom thE motiVatioN iN thE iNtRodUCtioN that

iN thE DECISION PRoCEss. SCoREs COULD LEAD COMMITtEE mEmBERs to FoREGo USEFUL PRiVatE

oF sCoREs oN thE DEFAULT PRoBaBiLity FRom tREatmENts T 1 aNd T 2, WE FIND thE samE REsULt

PREsENtEd iN TaBLE 6: thE POINT ESTIMATE is NEGatiVE BUt Not STATISTICaLLy DIﬀERENt FRom

zERo (Not SHOWN). INtERPREtiNG this as EVIDENCE that sCoREs do Not dEtERioRatE thE qUaLity

oF LENDiNG, thE REsULts IMPLy that most oF thE RELEVANT INFORMATION CONTAINED iN thE sCoREs

IN this SECTION, WE EVaLUatE thE EFFECT oF iNtRodUCiNG sCoREs By COMPaRiNG thE PILOT BRANCHEs

With a MATCHED SAMPLE oF CONTROL BRANCHES. ThERE aRE TWO RATIONALES FoR this aNaLysis. ThE

ﬁRst is that it ALLOWS US to TEST WhEthER thE iNtRodUCtioN oF sCoREs AFFECTEd thE iNPUts that

aRE FEd iNto thE LOAN PRODUCTION FUNCTION BEFoRE thE APPLiCatioN aRRiVEs iN thE COMMITtEE.

SINCE thE RANDOMIZATION OCCURS at thE COMMITtEE LEVEL aFtER thE SELECTION aNd iNFoRMATION

ThE SECOND RATIONALE is that thE SPILLOVERS DOCUMENTED iN thE PREVIOUS SECTION IMPLY

that thE COMPaRisoN oF tREatmENt aNd CONTROL APPLICATIONS MAY HIDE IMPORTANT EFFECTS oF

sUGGEst that aLL APPLiCatioNs iN PILOT BRANCHEs WERE DE FACTO TREATED dURiNG thE SECOND

This ANALYSIS COMPARES OUTCOMES oF thE PILOT BRANCHEs dURiNG thE WEEKs oF thE tRiaL

RELatiVE to othER WEEKs, aNd RELatiVE to PROPENSITY SCORE-MATCHED, NON-PILOT BRANCHEs oF thE

BANK dURiNG thE samE WEEKs. This is EqUiVaLENt to EstIMatiNG a DIﬀERENCE-iN-DIﬀERENCEs

EstIMatoR, SINCE thE tIMiNG oF thE iNtRodUCtioN oF thE PILOT aNd thE BRaNChEs iN WhiCh thE

EXPERIMENT Was RoLLEd oUt Was dEtERmiNEd By thE REsEaRChERs aNd Not By aN ENDoGENoUS

CHOICE oF thE BANK. WE ESTIMATE TWO TYPES oF DIﬀERENCE-iN-DIﬀERENCEs SPECIFICATIONs. ThE

ﬁRst ONE is at thE APPLICATION LEVEL:

Yi = Γ · P iLotW EEKBRaNCh

WhERE Yi is EithER aN APPLiCatioN ChaRaCtERistiC (E.G., BoRRoWER sCoRE, REQUESTED AMOUNT)

oR a LOAN OUTCOME (E.G., ISSUED LOAN AMOUNT, iN DEFAULT aFtER 12 MONTHS) FoR LOAN i.

ThE SPECIFICATION INCLUDES a FULL SET oF BRANCH FIXED-EFFECTS (ΑBRaNCh

, a DUMMY EQUAL to ONE iF thE BRaNCh WhERE LOAN i Was ISSUED Was a PILOT

ThE SECOND SPECIFICATION INCLUDES a sIMiLaR SET oF RiGht-HAND SIDE VARIABLEs BUt is Esti-

MATED aFtER aGGREGatiNG thE DATA at thE BRaNCh-WEEK LEVEL:

YJt = Γ(Cid:48) · P iLotW EEKJt + Α(Cid:48)

(4)

WhERE YJt is a BRANCH LEVEL OUTPUT (E.G., thE NUmBER oF LOANS ISSUED, thE aVERaGE aNd

STANDARD DEVIATION oF REALIZED LOAN RETURNS) oF BRANCH J dURiNG WEEK t.

ThEsE SPECIFICATIONs aRE ESTIMATED USING aLL thE LOANs APPRoVEd BEtWEEN WEEK 41 oF

2010 (FoUR WEEKs BEFoRE thE PILOT STARTING DATE) aNd WEEK 26 oF 2011 (FoUR WEEKs aFtER

31

thE PILOT END DATE). EVERy PILOT BRANCH is MATCHED With a CONTROL BRANCH SELECTED FRom

thE PoPULatioN oF BANK BRANCHES USING thE NEAREST DISTANCE MEASURED With a PRoPENsity

sCoRE. ThE PROPENSITY SCORE is ESTIMATED USING thE BRaNChEs’ NUmBER aNd TOTAL AMOUNT

oF LOANs APPRoVEd, AVERAGE APPROVED LOAN SIZE, aNd thE AVERAGE BORROWER SCORE iN OCtoBER

2010, thE MONTH PRioR to thE BEGiNNiNG oF thE PILOT.

5.1 LoaN SCREENiNG

WE PREsENt thE REsULts oF EstIMatiNG thE LOAN LEVEL SPECIFICATION (3) iN TaBLE 8. ThE RoLL-

oUt oF sCoREs iN a BRaNCh doEs Not haVE a STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT oN EithER thE sCoRE

oF thE APPLiCaNts that RECEiVE LOANs (COLUMN 1) oR oN thE AMOUNT oF thE LOAN REQUESTED

iN thE APPLiCatioN By LOAN RECIPIENTS (COLUMN 2). ThE FIRST MEASURE CAPTURES thE qUaLity

oF LOAN APPLICANTS as mEasUREd By thE RISK MODEL; thE SECOND thEiR qUaLity as assEssEd

By thE LOAN OFFICER iN thE ﬁELd (RECaLL that LOAN OFFICERS SEEM to adJUSt doWNWaRds thE

APPLICATION AMOUNT FoR RISKiER BoRRoWERs). ThUS, thEsE REsULts sUGGEst that sCoREs do Not

CHANGE APPLICANT SELECTION By LOAN OFFICERS, oR iF it doEs, thE ChaNGE iN APPLICANT SELECTION

is FULLY UNDONE By thE COMMITtEE.

EVEN iF APPLICANT SELECTION doEs Not ChaNGE, it is PossiBLE that sCoREs ChaNGE thE iN-

FORMATION COLLECTION EFFORT By thE oﬃCER. IF this is thE CasE, thEN thE iNFoRMATION iN thE

APPLiCatioNs, WhiCh is thE INFORMATION USED By thE DEFAULT MODEL to PREDICt thE sCoRE,

COULD CHANGE. To EVaLUatE WhEthER this is thE CasE, WE TEST WhEthER sCoREs’ PREDICtiVE

PoWER oF DEFAULT CHANGES dURiNG PILOT WEEKs. IN TaBLE 8, COLUMN 3, WE SHOW thE REsULts

oF ESTIMATING SPECIFICATION (3) USING a DEFAULT DUMMY as thE DEPENDENT VARIABLE. ThE

RiGht HAND-SIDE is aUGmENtEd With thE sCoRE, aNd thE sCoRE iNtERaCtEd With thE EXPERi-

MENT WEEK DUMMY. ThE COEFFICIENT oN thE iNtERACTION tERm, WhiCh REPREsENts thE ChaNGE

iN thE PREDICTIVE POWER oF sCoREs dURiNG thE PILOT, is Not STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT at thE

CONVENTIONAL LEVELS. This sUGGEsts that LOAN OFFICERS DId Not aLtER iN a siGNiﬁCaNt maNNER

32

thEiR INFORMATION COLLECTION EFFORT iN REsPoNsE to thE iNtRodUCtioN oF sCoREs.

5.2 BRaNCh OUtPUt aNd CAPitaL ALLoCatioN EﬃCiENCy

To EVaLUatE thE EFFECT oF sCoRE iNtRodUCtioN oN BRANCH OUTPUT WE USE thE BRaNCh-WEEK

SPECIFICATION (4) aNd PREsENt thE REsULts iN TaBLE 8. RoLLiNG oUt thE sCoREs iN a BRaNCh

NEithER AFFECTs thE NUmBER oF LOANs APPRoVEd iN a BRaNCh (COLUMN 4) NoR thE TOTAL AMOUNT

oF LENDiNG (COLUMN 5). ThEsE REsULts CoRRoBoRatE thE CoNCLUSioNs FRom thE PREVioUS sEC-

PREVioUSLy GENERatEd By maNaGERs With a HIGHER OPPORTUNITY COST oF TIME, oR By thE samE

COMMITtEE aFtER ENGaGiNG iN COSTLY INFORMATION COLLECTION.

IN othER WoRds, sCoREs aNd

COMMITTEE EFFORT SUBSTITUTE FoR moRE EXPENsiVE iNPUts to LOAN PRODUCTION.

WE ALSO INVESTIGATE WHETHER thE iNtRodUCtioN oF SCORES AFFECTS thE DEFAULT PRoBaBiLity

oF ISSUED LOANs. LoaNs ISSUED dURiNG thE PILOT WEEK haVE a DEFAULT PRoBaBiLity that is 1.2

PERCENtaGE PoiNts LOWER thaN LOANs iN CONTROL BRANCHES, aLthoUGh thE mEasUREd EFFECT is

siGNiﬁCaNt oNLy at thE 10% LEVEL (COLUMN 6). ThE POINT ESTIMATE IMPLIES a 12.6% dECLiNE

RELatiVE to thE BASELINE DEFAULT PROBABILITY iN thE CONTROL GROUP oF 9.5%. NotE that thE

dECLiNE iN thE DEFAULT PROBABILITY OCCURS EVEN THOUGH thE AVERAGE SCORE oF APPLiCaNts doEs

Not ChaNGE, WhiCh MEANS that thE DEFAULT PROBABILITY DROPS aBoVE aNd BEYOND What WOULD

BE PREDICtEd By a DEFAULT MODEL BASED oN EX ANTE BORROWER CHARACTERISTICS.

This REsULt is IMPoRtaNt BECaUSE it hiGhLiGhts that thE soURCE oF thE IMPRoVEmENt iN

LOAN PERFORMANCE is Not DUE to a BEttER SELECTION oF APPLICANTS BASED oN thEiR oBsERVaBLE

EX aNtE ChaRaCtERistiCs. INstEad, thE IMPRoVEmENt iN PERFORMANCE MAY BE DUE to adDI-

TIONAL INFORMATION PRODUCED By thE COMMITtEE dURiNG thE dELiBERatioN, oR BECaUSE thE

COMMITTEE USES EXISTING INFORMATION to BEttER taiLoR thE LOAN CONTRACT CHARACTERISTICS to

thE CiRCUmstaNCEs oF thE BoRRoWER. EithER oF thEsE MECHANISMS WOULD IMPLY that sCoREs

LEAD to a BETTER ALLOCATION oF CAPITAL ACROSS BORROWERS. A BETTER CAPITAL ALLOCATION IMPLIES,

33

iN tURN, aN iNCREasE iN thE EXPECtEd PRoﬁtaBiLity oF LENDiNG, aNd aN EqUaLizatioN oF thE

EXPECTED MARGINAL RETURN ACROSS LOANS. WE iNVEstiGatE this By EVALUATING thE EFFECT oF

RoLLiNG oUt sCoREs oN thE aVERaGE aNd thE CRoss-SECTIONAL STANDARD DEVIATION oF thE REaLizEd

GRoss REtURN oF LOANS ISSUED iN BRANCH J dURiNG WEEK t. ThE REALIZED GROSS RETURN oF a LOAN

is CaLCULatEd as thE Ratio oF thE COLLECTIONS DIVIDED By thE AMOUNT LENT. This Ratio GoEs

UP WhEN BoRRoWERs REPay a LaRGER AMOUNT oF PRiNCiPaL aNd INTEREST RELATIVE to thE AMOUNT

BoRRoWEd. CoNsistENt With thE dECLiNE iN DEFAULT RATES, thE RoLL-oUt oF SCORES ALSO INCREASED

thE AVERAGE REALIZED RETURN oF LENDiNG By 1.5 PERCENTAGE POINTS (COLUMN 7). CoNsistENt

With aN IMPRoVEmENt iN CAPITAL ALLOCATION ACROSS BORROWERS, WE FIND that thE VaRiatioN oF

REALIZED RETURNS ACROSS LOANS ISSUED By a BRANCH DROPS dURiNG PILOT WEEKs (COLUMN 8).

6 CoNCLUSioNs

ThE LAST SET oF REsULts is IMPoRtaNt BECaUSE thE oVERaLL EFFECT oF sCoREs oN thE ALLOCATION

oF CAPITAL is, iN thEoRy, amBiGUoUS. SCoREs MAY dRiVE COMMITtEE mEmBERs to CatER to thE

sCoRE aNd IGNORE SOFT INFORMATION. WE FIND that oN thE CoNtRaRy, sCoREs iNtERaCt With othER

oRGaNizatioNaL iNPUts to IMPROVE REPAYMENT aBoVE aNd BEYOND What thE LEVEL oF thE sCoRE

CaN PREDICt.

PUt toGEthER With thE EXPERIMENTaL REsULts, thE FINDINGS IMPLY that sCoRiNG tEChNoLoGiEs

IMPRoVE thE OVERALL EFFICIENCY oF LENDiNG thRoUGh TWO MECHANISMS: 1) thEy LOWER thE COST

oF LOAN PRODUCTION By iNCREasiNG thE PRodUCtiVity oF COMMITtEE mEmBERs, dECENtRaLiziNG

thE DECISION PRoCEss aNd sUBstitUtiNG FoR moRE EXPENsiVE iNPUts, aNd 2) thEy iNCREasE thE

EFFICIENCY oF CAPITAL ALLOCATION.

By dEsiGN, thE PILOT TRIAL HOLDS CONSTANT INTEREST RATES, maNaGERs’ sPaN oF CoNtRoL,

COMMITtEE mEmBERs’ COMPENSATION, aNd othER dIMENsioNs oF thE LOAN PRODUCTION PROCESS.

HoWEVER, thE NEW EQUILIBRIUM LEVEL FoR thEsE VaRiaBLEs is LiKELy to ChaNGE aFtER sCoRE

ADOPTION (INTEREST RATES MAY DROP to REﬂECt thE LOWER PRODUCTION COSTS, maNaGERs MAY

34

oVERSEE moRE BRaNChEs, EtC.). ThUS, thE ESTIMATED EFFECTS oN OUTPUT MIGHT Not CAPtURE

FULLy thE GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM IMPACT oF sCoREs. ChaNGEs aLoNG thEsE dIMENsioNs aRE LiKELy

to INDUCE FURthER IMPRoVEmENts iN PRodUCtiVity.

OUR RESULTS ALSO HIGHLIGHT that thERE aRE TWO POTENTIAL MECHANISMS that dRiVE thE

iNCREasE iN COMMITtEE PRodUCtiVity: PURE INFORMATION aNd INCENTIVES. WE EVaLUatE hoW

COMMITTEE DECISIONS CHANGE iN a tREatmENt that MAKES thE sCoRE AVAILABLE to aLL COMMITtEE

mEmBERs sooN aFtER thEy haVE REaChEd a DECISION to DIsENtaNGLE thE TWO MECHANISMS. WE

FIND that moRE thaN haLF oF thE iNCREasE iN COMMITTEE OUTPUT OCCURS as a REsPoNsE to thE

aNtiCiPatioN oF thE SCORES BECOMING AVAILABLE, hoLDING thE COMMITtEE’s INFORMATION SET

CoNstaNt. This sUGGEsts that thE INCENTIVE CHANNEL PLAYS a ﬁRst-oRdER RoLE iN thE oVERaLL

ThEsE FINDiNGs haVE INTERESTING IMPLICATIONS REGARDING thE dEsiGN oF INCENTIVES iNSIDE

ChaNGE thE FREqUENCy oF INCENTIVES to HELP LOAN OFFICERS OVERCOME PROCRASTINATION ISSUES.

It is sUGGEstiVE that thEsE RELATIVELY SUBTLE CHANGES iN hoW AGENTS aRE moNitoREd INDUCE

siGNiﬁCaNt ChaNGEs iN BEhaVioR. As sUCh, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS MAY REPRESENT
