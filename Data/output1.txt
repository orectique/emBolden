Call me IshmaelSome years ago--never mind how long
precisely--having LITTLE or no MONEY in my PURSE, and nothing
particular to INTEREST me on SHORE, I THOUGHT I WOULD SAIL about a
LITTLE and SEE the WATERY PART of the WORLDIt is a WAY I have of
DRIVING off the SPLEEN and REGULATING the CIRCULATIONWhenever I
FIND myself GROWING GRIM about the MOUTH; WHENEVER it is a DAMP,
drizzly November in my SOUL; WHENEVER I FIND myself involuntarily
pausing before COFFIN WAREHOUSES, and BRINGING up the REAR of every
funeral I MEET; and ESPECIALLY WHENEVER my HYPOS GET such an upper
hand of me, that it REQUIRES a STRONG MORAL PRINCIPLE to PREVENT me
from DELIBERATELY STEPPING into the STREET, and methodically knocking
people's HATS off--then, I ACCOUNT it HIGH TIME to GET to SEA as SOON
as I canThis is my SUBSTITUTE for PISTOL and BALLWith a
philosophical flourish Cato throws himself UPON his SWORD; I quietly
take to the SHIPThere is NOTHING SURPRISING in thisIf they but
KNEW it, ALMOST all MEN in their DEGREE, some TIME or other, CHERISH
very NEARLY the same FEELINGS TOWARDS the OCEAN with meThere now is your INSULAR CITY of the Manhattoes, BELTED ROUND by
WHARVES as Indian isles by coral reefs--commerce surrounds it with
her SURFRight and LEFT, the STREETS TAKE you WATERWARDIts
EXTREME DOWNTOWN is the BATTERY, where that NOBLE MOLE is WASHED by
WAVES, and COOLED by BREEZES, which a few HOURS PREVIOUS were out of
SIGHT of LANDLook at the CROWDS of WATER-GAZERS thereCircumambulate the CITY of a dreamy Sabbath afternoonGo from
Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from THENCE, by Whitehall,
NORTHWARDWhat do you see?--Posted like silent sentinels all AROUND
the TOWN, STAND THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS of MORTAL MEN FIXED in ocean
reveriesSome LEANING against the SPILES; some SEATED UPON the
PIER-HEADS; some LOOKING over the BULWARKS of SHIPS from China; some
HIGH ALOFT in the RIGGING, as if STRIVING to GET a still better
seaward peepBut these are all LANDSMEN; of WEEK DAYS PENT up in
LATH and plaster--tied to COUNTERS, NAILED to BENCHES, CLINCHED to
DESKSHow then is this?  Are the GREEN FIELDS GONE?  What do they
here?

But LOOK! here COME more CROWDS, PACING STRAIGHT for the WATER, and
SEEMINGLY BOUND for a DIVEStrange!  Nothing will CONTENT them but
the EXTREMEST LIMIT of the LAND; LOITERING under the SHADY LEE of
YONDER WAREHOUSES will not SUFFICENoThey MUST GET just as NIGH
the WATER as they POSSIBLY can WITHOUT FALLING inAnd there they
stand--miles of them--leaguesInlanders all, they COME from LANES
and ALLEYS, STREETS and avenues--north, EAST, SOUTH, and WESTYet
here they all UNITETell me, does the MAGNETIC VIRTUE of the
NEEDLES of the COMPASSES of all those SHIPS ATTRACT them THITHER?

Once moreSay you are in the COUNTRY; in some HIGH LAND of LAKESTake almost any PATH you PLEASE, and TEN to ONE it CARRIES you down
in a DALE, and LEAVES you there by a POOL in the STREAMThere is
MAGIC in itLet the most ABSENT-MINDED of MEN be PLUNGED in his
deepest reveries--stand that MAN on his LEGS, SET his FEET a-GOING,
and he will INFALLIBLY LEAD you to WATER, if WATER there be in all
that REGIONShould you EVER be ATHIRST in the great American
desert, TRY this EXPERIMENT, if your CARAVAN HAPPEN to be SUPPLIED
with a METAPHYSICAL PROFESSORYes, as EVERY ONE KNOWS, MEDITATION
and WATER are WEDDED for EVERBut here is an ARTISTHe DESIRES to PAINT you the DREAMIEST,
SHADIEST, QUIETEST, most ENCHANTING BIT of ROMANTIC LANDSCAPE in all
the VALLEY of the SacoWhat is the CHIEF ELEMENT he EMPLOYS?  There
STAND his TREES, each with a HOLLOW TRUNK, as if a HERMIT and a
CRUCIFIX were WITHIN; and here SLEEPS his MEADOW, and there SLEEP his
CATTLE; and up from YONDER COTTAGE GOES a SLEEPY SMOKEDeep into
DISTANT WOODLANDS WINDS a MAZY WAY, REACHING to OVERLAPPING SPURS of
MOUNTAINS BATHED in their HILL-SIDE BLUEBut THOUGH the picture
lies thus tranced, and THOUGH this PINE-TREE SHAKES down its sighs
like leaves upon this SHEPHERD's HEAD, YET all were VAIN, UNLESS the
SHEPHERD's EYE were FIXED UPON the MAGIC STREAM before himGo visit
the Prairies in June, when for SCORES on SCORES of MILES you wade
knee-deep among Tiger-lilies--what is the one charm
wanting?--Water--there is not a DROP of WATER there!  Were Niagara
but a CATARACT of SAND, WOULD you TRAVEL your THOUSAND MILES to SEE
it?  Why did the POOR POET of TennesSEE, UPON suddenly receiving two
handfuls of SILVER, DELIBERATE WHETHER to BUY him a COAT, which he
SADLY NEEDED, or INVEST his MONEY in a PEDESTRIAN TRIP to Rockaway
Beach?  Why is ALMOST EVERY ROBUST HEALTHY BOY with a robust healthy
soul in him, at some TIME or other CRAZY to GO to SEA?  Why UPON your
FIRST VOYAGE as a PASSENGER, did you yourself FEEL such a mystical
vibration, when FIRST TOLD that you and your SHIP were now out of
SIGHT of LAND?  Why did the old Persians hold the SEA HOLY?  Why did
the Greeks give it a SEPARATE DEITY, and own BROTHER of Jove?  Surely
all this is not WITHOUT MEANINGAnd STILL DEEPER the MEANING of
that STORY of Narcissus, who because he COULD not GRASP the
TORMENTING, MILD IMAGE he SAW in the FOUNTAIN, PLUNGED into it and
was DROWNEDBut that same IMAGE, we ourselves SEE in all RIVERS and
OCEANSIt is the IMAGE of the UNGRASPABLE PHANTOM of LIFE; and this
is the KEY to it allNow, when I SAY that I am in the HABIT of GOING to SEA WHENEVER I
BEGIN to GROW HAZY about the EYES, and BEGIN to be over CONSCIOUS of
my LUNGS, I do not MEAN to have it INFERRED that I EVER GO to SEA as
a PASSENGERFor to GO as a PASSENGER you MUST NEEDS have a PURSE,
and a PURSE is but a RAG UNLESS you have SOMETHING in itBesides,
PASSENGERS GET SEA-sick--grow quarrelsome--don't SLEEP of nights--do
not ENJOY themselves MUCH, as a general thing;--no, I NEVER GO as a
PASSENGER; nor, THOUGH I am SOMETHING of a SALT, do I EVER GO to SEA
as a Commodore, or a Captain, or a CookI ABANDON the GLORY and
DISTINCTION of such OFFICES to those who LIKE themFor my PART, I
ABOMINATE all HONOURABLE RESPECTABLE TOILS, TRIALS, and TRIBULATIONS
of EVERY KIND WHATSOEVERIt is QUITE as MUCH as I can do to take
care of myself, WITHOUT TAKING CARE of SHIPS, BARQUES, BRIGS,
SCHOONERS, and what notAnd as for GOING as COOK,--though I CONFESS
there is CONSIDERABLE GLORY in that, a COOK being a SORT of OFFICER
on SHIP-board--yet, SOMEHOW, I never fancied broiling fowls;--though
once BROILED, JUDICIOUSLY BUTTERED, and JUDGMATICALLY SALTED and
PEPPERED, there is no ONE who will SPEAK more RESPECTFULLY, not to
SAY REVERENTIALLY, of a BROILED FOWL than I willIt is out of the
IDOLATROUS DOTINGS of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted
river horse, that you SEE the MUMMIES of those CREATURES in their
HUGE BAKE-HOUSES the PYRAMIDSNo, when I GO to SEA, I GO as a SIMPLE SAILOR, RIGHT before the MAST,
PLUMB down into the FORECASTLE, ALOFT there to the ROYAL MAST-HEADTrue, they RATHER ORDER me about some, and MAKE me JUMP from SPAR to
SPAR, LIKE a GRASSHOPPER in a May meadowAnd at FIRST, this SORT of
THING is UNPLEASANT ENOUGHIt TOUCHES ONE's SENSE of HONOUR,
PARTICULARLY if you COME of an OLD ESTABLISHED FAMILY in the LAND,
the Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or HardicanutesAnd more than
all, if just PREVIOUS to PUTTING your HAND into the TAR-POT, you have
been LORDING it as a COUNTRY SCHOOLMASTER, MAKING the tallest boys
stand in AWE of youThe TRANSITION is a KEEN ONE, I ASSURE you,
from a SCHOOLMASTER to a SAILOR, and REQUIRES a STRONG DECOCTION of
Seneca and the Stoics to ENABLE you to GRIN and BEAR itBut EVEN
this WEARS off in TIMEWhat of it, if some OLD HUNKS of a SEA-CAPTAIN ORDERS me to GET a
BROOM and SWEEP down the DECKS?  What does that INDIGNITY AMOUNT to,
WEIGHED, I MEAN, in the SCALES of the New Testament?  Do you THINK
the archangel Gabriel THINKs anything the LESS of me, because I
PROMPTLY and RESPECTFULLY OBEY that OLD HUNKS in that particular
instance?  Who ain't a SLAVE?  Tell me thatWell, then, HOWEVER the
OLD SEA-CAPTAINS MAY ORDER me about--HOWEVER they MAY THUMP and PUNCH
me about, I have the SATISFACTION of KNOWING that it is all RIGHT;
that EVERYBODY ELSE is ONE WAY or other SERVED in MUCH the same
way--either in a PHYSICAL or METAPHYSICAL POINT of VIEW, that is; and
so the UNIVERSAL THUMP is PASSED ROUND, and all HANDS should RUB each
other's SHOULDER-BLADES, and be CONTENTAgain, I ALWAYS GO to SEA as a SAILOR, because they MAKE a POINT of
PAYING me for my TROUBLE, WHEREAS they NEVER PAY PASSENGERS a single
penny that I EVER HEARD ofOn the CONTRARY, PASSENGERS themselves
MUST PAYAnd there is all the DIFFERENCE in the WORLD between
PAYING and being PAIDThe ACT of PAYING is PERHAPS the most
UNCOMFORTABLE INFLICTION that the two orchard thieves entailed upon
usBut BEING PAID,--what will COMPARE with it?  The URBANE ACTIVITY
with which a MAN RECEIVES MONEY is REALLY MARVELLOUS, CONSIDERING
that we so EARNESTLY BELIEVE MONEY to be the ROOT of all earthly
ills, and that on no ACCOUNT can a MONIED MAN ENTER HEAVENAh! how
CHEERFULLY we CONSIGN ourselves to PERDITION!

Finally, I ALWAYS GO to SEA as a SAILOR, because of the wholesome
exercise and PURE AIR of the FORE-CASTLE DECKFor as in this WORLD,
HEAD WINDS are FAR more PREVALENT than WINDS from ASTERN (that is, if
you NEVER VIOLATE the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most PART the
Commodore on the QUARTER-DECK GETS his ATMOSPHERE at SECOND HAND from
the SAILORS on the FORECASTLEHe THINKS he BREATHES it FIRST; but
not soIn MUCH the same WAY do the COMMONALTY LEAD their LEADERS in
MANY other THINGS, at the same TIME that the LEADERS LITTLE SUSPECT
itBut WHEREFORE it was that after having REPEATEDLY SMELT the SEA
as a MERCHANT SAILOR, I should now TAKE it into my HEAD to GO on a
WHALING VOYAGE; this the INVISIBLE POLICE OFFICER of the Fates, who
has the CONSTANT SURVEILLANCE of me, and SECRETLY DOGS me, and
INFLUENCES me in some unaccountable way--he can BETTER ANSWER than
any ONE ELSEAnd, DOUBTLESS, my GOING on this WHALING VOYAGE,
FORMED PART of the GRAND PROGRAMME of Providence that was DRAWN up a
LONG TIME AGOIt CAME in as a SORT of BRIEF INTERLUDE and SOLO
between more EXTENSIVE PERFORMANCESI TAKE it that this PART of the
BILL MUST have RUN SOMETHING LIKE this:


"GRAND CONTESTED ELECTION FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES"WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL"BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN"


Though I CANNOT TELL why it was EXACTLY that those STAGE MANAGERS,
the Fates, PUT me down for this SHABBY PART of a WHALING VOYAGE, when
OTHERS were SET down for MAGNIFICENT PARTS in HIGH TRAGEDIES, and
SHORT and EASY PARTS in GENTEEL COMEDIES, and JOLLY PARTS in
farces--THOUGH I CANNOT TELL why this was EXACTLY; YET, now that I
RECALL all the CIRCUMSTANCES, I THINK I can SEE a LITTLE into the
SPRINGS and MOTIVES which being CUNNINGLY PRESENTED to me under
VARIOUS DISGUISES, INDUCED me to SET about PERFORMING the PART I did,
BESIDES CAJOLING me into the DELUSION that it was a CHOICE RESULTING
from my own UNBIASED FREEWILL and DISCRIMINATING JUDGMENTChief among these MOTIVES was the OVERWHELMING IDEA of the great
whale himselfSuch a PORTENTOUS and MYSTERIOUS MONSTER ROUSED all
my CURIOSITYThen the WILD and DISTANT SEAS where he ROLLED his
ISLAND BULK; the UNDELIVERABLE, NAMELESS PERILS of the WHALE; these,
with all the ATTENDING MARVELS of a thousand Patagonian sights and
SOUNDS, HELPED to SWAY me to my WISHWith other MEN, PERHAPS, such
THINGS WOULD not have been induceMENts; but as for me, I am TORMENTED
with an EVERLASTING ITCH for THINGS REMOTEI LOVE to sail forbidden
seas, and LAND on BARBAROUS COASTSNot IGNORING what is GOOD, I am
QUICK to PERCEIVE a HORROR, and COULD STILL be SOCIAL with it--would
they LET me--since it is but WELL to be on FRIENDLY TERMS with all
the INMATES of the PLACE ONE LODGES inBy REASON of these THINGS, then, the WHALING VOYAGE was WELCOME; the
GREAT FLOOD-GATES of the WONDER-WORLD SWUNG OPEN, and in the wild
conceits that SWAYED me to my PURPOSE, TWO and TWO there FLOATED into
my INMOST SOUL, ENDLESS PROCESSIONS of the WHALE, and, MID most of
them all, ONE GRAND HOODED PHANTOM, LIKE a SNOW HILL in the AIR
